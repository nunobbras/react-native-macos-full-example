#A Desktop OSX application done with react native that integrates native (objective-C) code.

###Using the fabulous react-native-macos and some local, objective-C inspector


This code is an app used as MVP for a company that didn't worked out. 

It is an application that allows to make a hardware inspection in OSX laptops and desktops and sell in second hand with a quality stamp. You can use it as a template to start your own react native desktop application and understand how to call a local Obj-C library.

If you need some help just send me some message.

Have fun!
